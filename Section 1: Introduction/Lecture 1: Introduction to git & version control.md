# Introduction to Version Control

## 1. What is Version Control?

* **Version Control** is a system that manages different versions of files (e.g., code, documents).
* It keeps track of **changes over time**, allowing you to:

  * Collaborate with others.
  * View the history of changes.
  * Restore older versions if needed.

---

## 2. Understanding "Versions"

* A **version** is simply a new state of something after changes.
* **Examples:**

  * **Books**: A 2nd edition of a book with extra chapters is a new version.
  * **Apps**: Frequent WhatsApp updates (v2.21, v2.22, etc.) are versions with fixes/features.

---

## 3. Why Version Control?

* Helps **multiple developers work together** on the same project without overwriting each other’s work.
* Provides a **history of changes** (who made changes, what changed, when).
* Makes it possible to **revert to previous versions** if mistakes occur.
* Ensures the **safety of original code** by maintaining structured versions.

## 4. What is Git?

* **Git** = A **Version Control System (VCS)**.
* Also called a **Source Code Management System (SCM)**.
* With Git, developers can:

  * Track changes in code.
  * Create and manage multiple versions.
  * Work collaboratively without disturbing others’ code.

---

## 5. Example Scenario

* Imagine a team of **10 developers** building one application:

  * Without version control → chaos, risk of overwriting, possible loss of original code.
  * With version control → every change is tracked, saved as a new version, and easily reversible.

**Key Takeaway**:
Version Control is essential for team collaboration, code safety, and history tracking.
**Git** is the most popular version control tool used by developers worldwide.
