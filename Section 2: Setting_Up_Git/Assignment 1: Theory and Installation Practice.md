## **üí° Solutions** (For Udemy Instructor Review Only)  

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Version Control:**  
- Version control tracks changes to files, allowing multiple people to collaborate and revert to previous versions if needed.  
- Benefits: Prevents loss of work, enables collaboration, keeps history of changes.  
- Example: A writer saving multiple drafts of a novel before publishing.  

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Git vs. Other VCS:**  
- Git is **distributed**, meaning every developer has a full copy of the repository.  
- Key Advantages: **Faster, allows offline work, better branching/merging.**  

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Git Concept Matching:**  
| **Git Concept** | **Correct Definition** |
|------------|-----------|
| **Git** | A system that tracks changes in code and allows collaboration. |
| **Repository** | A place where Git stores all versions of your project. |
| **Branching** | The ability to create a separate line of development without affecting the main project. |
| **Merging** | The process of combining different branches into a single branch. |

4Ô∏è‚É£ **Installing Git:**  
- Install Git from [Git-SCM](https://git-scm.com/downloads) based on OS.  
- Screenshot of **successful installation required**.  

5Ô∏è‚É£ **Verifying Git:**
