# **Study Notes: Introduction to Version Control**

## **How Do Developers Work Together on Code?**
Imagine a team of 10 software developers working on the same project. Every day, they make changes to the code—fixing bugs, adding features, and improving performance. But here’s a question:

**How do they keep track of all these changes without messing up the original project?**  

If everyone edits the same file at the same time, things can get chaotic. Someone might overwrite another person’s work, or a mistake could break the entire project.  

This is where **Version Control** comes in.

## **Understanding Versions**
To understand version control, let’s take an example from everyday life.

Imagine you’re writing a novel. You finish **Chapter 1** and save the document. The next day, you make edits and save the file as **"Chapter_1_v2.docx"**.  

Later, you realize you preferred the original version. But now, your document is cluttered with multiple versions like:  
✅ Chapter_1_v1.docx  
✅ Chapter_1_v2.docx  
✅ Chapter_1_final.docx  
✅ Chapter_1_final_revised.docx  

Keeping track of these versions manually is **frustrating and inefficient**.  

This is exactly the problem developers face when working on software projects. They need a way to **save multiple versions of their code in an organized way**—which is what version control does.

## **What is Version Control?**
**Version Control is a system that tracks changes to files over time.** It allows developers to:  
✔ **Save different versions** of their code.  
✔ **Revert back** to an older version if something breaks.  
✔ **Collaborate** with teammates without overwriting each other's work.  

For example, think of a Google Doc. When you edit a document in Google Docs, it automatically **saves every version** and lets you view the **edit history**.  
You can see:  
✔ Who made changes  
✔ What was changed  
✔ Restore an earlier version if needed  

Version Control Systems (VCS) work in a similar way but for **software code**.

## **Why is Version Control Important?**
Here’s a **real-world scenario** to illustrate why version control is crucial:  

Imagine a software company building an **e-commerce website**. Developers are working on different sections—payments, product listings, and user accounts.  

Without version control:

- Developer A makes a change that accidentally deletes Developer B’s code.
- The website crashes, and they can’t undo the changes.
- The team has no record of who made what changes.  

With version control:
✅ Every change is **saved as a version** (like a checkpoint).  
✅ Developers can **restore previous versions** anytime.  
✅ Multiple developers can work **simultaneously** without conflicts.  

Version control **makes software development faster, safer, and more organized**.

## **How Does Version Control Work?**
A version control system stores project files in a **repository**. Every time you make changes, you **commit** them to the repository, which creates a **new version** of the project.

A simple workflow looks like this:

- **Initialize a repository** (Start tracking files).
- **Make changes** and save them as new versions.
- **Collaborate** by merging changes from different developers.
- **Revert** back to older versions if needed.  

In the next lecture, we’ll introduce **Git**—one of the most popular version control systems.
