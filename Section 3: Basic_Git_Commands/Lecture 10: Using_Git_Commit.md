# **Using Git Commit**

Now that we understand how to add files to the **staging area** using `git add`, it‚Äôs time to learn how to **save** our changes permanently in the Git repository using `git commit`.

When we modify a file, Git **does not automatically save those changes**. Instead, we need to **commit** our work to track changes properly. This helps keep a clear history of what was changed, when, and why.

Think of **Git commits** as **checkpoints in your project**‚Äîthey help you go back in time if needed and provide a structured way to track project changes.

## **What is `git commit`?**
The `git commit` command **permanently records** changes from the **staging area** into the **repository**.

- It **saves your work** in Git‚Äôs version history.  
- It assigns a **unique identifier** (commit hash) to each change.  
- It allows you to **roll back changes** if needed.  
- It helps **collaborators** understand what changes were made.

**Analogy:** Think of **committing** like submitting an assignment in school. Until you submit it, your teacher (Git) doesn't recognize your progress.

## **Understanding Commit Messages**
Every commit includes a **message** that explains what changes were made.  

This message is important because:
- It helps developers **understand the purpose of the commit**.
- It allows teams to **collaborate efficiently**.
- It serves as a **historical reference** for future debugging.

### **Commit Message Format**
When committing changes, we use the `-m` flag to provide a short description of the commit:
```
git commit -m "Short message describing the change"
```

**Good commit message examples**:
```
git commit -m "Fixed navigation bar responsiveness"
git commit -m "Updated README with project setup instructions"
git commit -m "Refactored API response handling"
```

**Bad commit message examples**:
```
git commit -m "Fixed stuff"
git commit -m "Updated files"
git commit -m "Commit changes"
```
A **clear and meaningful** commit message improves collaboration and code maintenance.

## **How to Commit Changes**
### **Step 1: Ensure Changes are Staged**
Before committing, make sure your files are added to the **staging area** using:
```
git add .
```

### **Step 2: Commit the Changes**
Once your files are staged, commit them using:
```
git commit -m "Initial commit"
```
**Expected Output**:
```
[master (root-commit) 1a2b3c4] Initial commit
 1 file changed, 10 insertions(+)
 create mode 100644 index.html
```
This means:
- Git has successfully **recorded** your changes.
- **1 file changed** (index.html).
- **10 lines** were added.
- A unique **commit hash** (`1a2b3c4`) was generated.

## **Key Takeaways**
‚úîÔ∏è `git commit` saves changes **permanently** in Git‚Äôs history.  
‚úîÔ∏è Every commit requires a **descriptive message** to explain what changed.   
‚úîÔ∏è A commit is like a **snapshot of your project** at a specific point in time.  

Now that we have committed our changes, let‚Äôs move on to **viewing commit history: git log** in the next lecture. üöÄ
